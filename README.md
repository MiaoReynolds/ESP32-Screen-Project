# ESP32-Screen-Project

This project showcases a simple yet effective Pomodoro timer built with an ESP32 and an integrated 1.3 OLED display with knob and buttons. It can be used for more interesting projects as well

## ðŸ§° Hardware Components
- A 1.3-inch SH1106 OLED display connected via I2C (SDA=GPIO19, SCL=GPIO23)
- An EC11 rotary encoder (A=GPIO5, B=GPIO17, Push=GPIO18)
- A Confirm button on GPIO22 (functions the same as the rotary push button)
- A Back button on GPIO16 (used to exit countdown and return to main menu)
- Picture of the complete set. More pictures will be released soon.

GPT Prompt for the Code: Generate Arduino C++ code for an ESP32-based Pomodoro timer using the following hardware setup:

A 1.3-inch SH1106 OLED display connected via I2C (SDA=GPIO19, SCL=GPIO23)
An EC11 rotary encoder (A=GPIO5, B=GPIO17, Push=GPIO18)
A Confirm button on GPIO22 (functions the same as the rotary push button)
A Back button on GPIO16 (used to exit countdown and return to main menu)
Requirements: 1. Display a scrollable menu of five options: "Pomodoro 10 min", "Pomodoro 15 min", "Pomodoro 20 min", "Pomodoro 25 min", and "Info". 2. Show 4 menu items on screen at a time, and highlight the currently selected one. 3. Use the rotary encoder to scroll through the menu, and use either the rotary push button or the Confirm button to start a Pomodoro countdown. 4. During countdown, display the remaining time in mm:ss format in large centered digits. 5. Pressing the Back button at any time during the countdown returns to the main menu. 6. Selecting "Info" displays author information for 3 seconds before returning to the menu. 7. Do not include any buzzer or sound feedback. 8. Use the U8g2 library and appropriate fonts for the OLED screen.
